Thanks for sharing your **Spotify macro JSON** file. Based on its logic and the description you gave (skipping tracks after \~32–45 seconds, but occasionally letting songs play fully for natural behavior), here’s a **professional GitHub project description** you can use:

# 🎵 Spotify Smart Skipping Macro

## 📌 Overview

This project is an **automation macro** built for Spotify that mimics natural listening behavior by automatically skipping tracks after a set duration, while occasionally allowing songs to play in full.
It was developed for a client who needed a **customized music playback pattern**, and the solution has been tested and is functioning flawlessly.

## ⚙️ Features

* ⏩ **Smart Skipping Logic**

  * Automatically skips songs after **32–45 seconds** of playback.
  * Uses randomized timing for natural behavior.

* 🎶 **Occasional Full Playback**

  * About **20% of the time**, the macro lets the track play fully.
  * Helps simulate genuine listening activity.

* 🖱️ **Automated Controls**

  * Records and replays precise mouse interactions for play/pause/skip.
  * Built as a JSON-based macro script for easy import/export.

* 🔄 **Looping & Configuration**

  * Adjustable loop iterations and intervals.
  * Can restart the player after a set duration.

## 🛠 Development Process

1. **Macro Recording** – The base interactions (skip, play, pause) were recorded using a macro recorder tool.
2. **Logic Adjustment** – Timings were customized to trigger skips after \~32–45 seconds.
3. **Randomization** – A probability-based function was added so that \~20% of the time the track is allowed to play fully, simulating natural user behavior.
4. **Client Delivery & Testing** – The macro was tested extensively in Spotify to ensure stability and accuracy. The final version was delivered to the client, who reported **100% satisfaction** with performance.

## 🚀 How It Works

* The macro runs in the background while Spotify is active.
* It tracks playback time, triggers skip events at randomized intervals, and occasionally lets songs play fully.
* All interactions are simulated via recorded mouse clicks, ensuring compatibility with the Spotify client.
