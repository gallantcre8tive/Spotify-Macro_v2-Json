# Spotify-Macro_v2-Json
This project is an automation macro built for Spotify that mimics natural listening behavior by automatically skipping tracks after a set duration, while occasionally allowing songs to play in full. It was developed for a client who needed a customized music playback pattern, and the solution has been tested and is functioning flawlessly.
